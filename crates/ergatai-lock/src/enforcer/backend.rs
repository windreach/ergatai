//! Platform backend trait and shared types for cross-platform file access enforcement.
//!
//! This module defines the abstraction layer that allows the enforcer to use
//! platform-specific mechanisms (fanotify on Linux, Endpoint Security on macOS,
//! Minifilter on Windows) through a unified interface.

///
/// 1. `start()` — initialize the platform mechanism, begin intercepting
/// 2. `next_event()` — async; yields the next file access event
/// 3. `respond()` — allow or deny a specific event at the kernel level
/// 4. `stop()` — tear down the mechanism, release all resources
///
/// # Fail-open contract
///
/// If `start()` fails, the backend returns `Ok(None)` from `next_event()`
/// immediately (stream terminates). The facade interprets this as
/// "disable enforcement" and transitions to advisory mode.
///
/// Implementations MUST ensure that `respond()` with `EnforcementResult::Allow`
/// is always reachable — even if the decision engine panics, the backend
/// must allow the access (fail-open). This is enforced via RAII guards
/// in each platform implementation.
